        This is a simple to do application that will help you demonstrate a simple transition from JavaScript to
        TypeScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main idea is not to translate the application all at once, but gradually. This will distribute the work on
        the migration and keep the application running.

        TypeScript is an open-source language which builds on JavaScript, one of the worldâ€™s most used tools, by adding
        static type definitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing TypeScript
        to validate that your code is working correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Writing types can be optional in TypeScript, because type inference allows you to get a lot of power without
        writing additional code.
